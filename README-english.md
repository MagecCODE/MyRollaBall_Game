Welcome to this one-of-a-kind entertainment experience!
***WATCH OUT NINTENDO, PLAYSTATION and XBOX***, My Roll a Ball Game - DEMO is a technical demo designed to understand the principles of development in ***UNITY*** and if all goes well, sell millions of copies across all platforms 😊

## Getting Started 🚀

You can clone the repository and start working in UNITY and Visual Studio Code to play around with the code, once you have the IDE, run the build to create the installer and test the demo.

### Prerequisites 📋

You’ll need to install Unity and preferably Visual Studio Code.
To run the demo, you’ll need an RTX 5090, I9 Ultra, and a 55" OLED 4K TV 🤓

**A little humor never hurts**

But seriously, for Git compatibility reasons, the Builds folder cannot be uploaded and is covered in the .gitignore file.

### Installing 🔧

Just clone the repository to your folder, and once you have it cloned and the Unity package installed, I'll give you a link to build it and run the demo.
