Welcome to this one-of-a-kind entertainment experience!
***WATCH OUT NINTENDO, PLAYSTATION and XBOX***, My Roll a Ball Game - DEMO is a technical demo designed to understand the principles of development in ***UNITY*** and if all goes well, sell millions of copies across all platforms 😊

## Getting Started 🚀

You can clone the repository and start working in UNITY and Visual Studio Code to play around with the code, or run the build to test the demo.

### Prerequisites 📋

You’ll need to install Unity and preferably Visual Studio Code.
To run the demo, you’ll need an RTX 5090, I9 Ultra, and a 55" OLED 4K TV 🤓

**A little humor never hurts**

But seriously, the build was made for Windows ***SORRY***, so don’t be a goat and try to install it on anything other than Windows.

### Installing 🔧
